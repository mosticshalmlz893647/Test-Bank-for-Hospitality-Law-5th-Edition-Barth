  * Hospitality Law: Managing Legal Issues in the Hospitality Industry, Fifth Edition takes an applied approach to the study of hospitality law with its touchstone of compliance and prevention. The book is highly pedagogical and includes many interactive exercises and real world cases that help students focus on the practical application of hospitality laws and model their decision process to avoid liability. As a result, this book does look different than others on the market as the legal information contained is carefully selected to specifically correlate with helping students understand how to do the right thing, i.e., it is not a comprehensive book on the laws.
 
  * Barth immediately helps readers learn about the legalities of situations and work through exercises – both individually and in groups -- to effectively apply them to hospitality management situations. Many instructors teach their course from a very applied perspective, which aligns with Barth’s approach.
